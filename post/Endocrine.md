1. Subclinical Thyrotoxicosis: ↓ TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels Cause: Rx with levothyroxine, nodular thyroid disease, grave’s disease, thyroiditis.  
	Mild symptoms: no rx, repeat TSH in 6-8 weeks.
Symptoms: Antithyroid drug in small dose: Methimazole 5-10mg/day after doing radioactive iodine uptake scan. If symptoms improve with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation is usually performed.
Pheochromocytoma: CT/MRI first. Followed by..
MIBG (Metaiodobenzylguznide) scan if imaging negative, large tumor, young or familial patients. 
10. Pancreatogenic Diabetes Melitus : Patients with PD are prone to developing hypoglycemia due to loss of glucagon-producing alpha cells in addition to the loss of beta cells.  (In type 1 diabetes, there is loss of beta cells, but alpha cells are largely intact and can secrete glucagon in response to hypoglycemia).  However, due to loss of glucagon secretion, diabetic ketoacidosis is rare in PD despite insulin deficiency.

	Incretin-based therapy, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (eg, linagliptin, sitagliptin) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (eg, liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide), is associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis and should be avoided in patients with a history of pancreatitis.

Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Ethosuxamide, Phenobarbital, Topiramate : Induce c P450 and decrease efficacy of OCPs

Other anti seizure medication: Gabapentin and Valproate : do not induce cp450
